Grid Maker is a browser-based grid maker online. Upload any picture, add a precise drawing grid, and export a ready-to-use reference for sketching, portraits, product layouts, or teaching. Everything runs in your browser—no install—so you can focus on proportions and composition instead of measuring by hand.

## Why Grid Maker

- **Upload any picture**: Turn reference photos, sketches, and screenshots into guides with clean squares for accurate outlines and compositions.  
- **Custom grids in seconds**: Set rows/columns, adjust line thickness and opacity, switch units, and keep grids consistent across projects.  
- **Work anywhere**: Open it on desktop, tablet, or phone; settings stay with you as you move between devices.  
- **Smart helpers**: Snap to common ratios, preview densities, and compare versions so you stay in a creative flow.

## How It Works (Quick Start)

1) Upload an image (JPG/PNG/WebP up to 15MB); drag and drop or click to browse.  
2) Set rows/columns, choose line color/opacity/width, and toggle labels (A1, B2…).  
3) Pick a paper format (A2/A3/A4/A5, Letter, Legal) or enter custom width/height in mm.  
4) Preview the overlay, optionally convert to black & white, then download the grid image.  
5) Use the auto printing guide to mirror line counts and intervals on paper or confirm spacing for digital work.

## Key Features

- Browser-based, no install; always the latest version.  
- Precision controls for rows, columns, and units; great for portraits, landscapes, products, and thumbnails.  
- Save and reuse presets for common canvas sizes, classroom exercises, or client templates.  
- Flexible exports (high-res images for digital work, printable references for sketchbooks or canvases).  
- Optimized for photo grids and drawing grids; labels for teaching and step-by-step transfers.  
- Friendly defaults for beginners, with enough control for pros.

## Who Uses It

- Illustrators, portrait artists, and concept artists keeping proportions consistent.  
- Teachers and students practicing the grid method and line placement.  
- Photographers and creators planning balanced layouts for social posts and carousels.  
- Designers and hobbyists preparing accurate references for any medium.

## Tips for Best Results

- Choose grid density to match your scale: fewer cells for loose sketches, more for detailed work.  
- Lower opacity for on-screen reference; raise it for print.  
- Square mode helps maintain proportions across devices and paper sizes.  
- Re-download after changing paper size or line settings to keep guides accurate.
