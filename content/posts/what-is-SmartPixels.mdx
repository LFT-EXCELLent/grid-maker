Smart Pixels is an AI portrait generator and editor that transforms everyday photos into studio‑grade portraits in a single tap. Whether you’re preparing wedding or maternity photos, refreshing your personal brand headshots, elevating travel memories, or creating polished pet portraits, Smart Pixels helps you produce professional results in seconds—without booking a studio, learning complex software, or hiring a photographer.

## Why Smart Pixels

Smart Pixels addresses the gap between everyday photography and studio‑ready portrait outcomes. Traditional shoots require planning, cost, and post‑production expertise. Generic photo apps often over‑process or flatten personality. Smart Pixels takes a different approach: it understands faces, body shapes, lighting and backgrounds, then applies natural, flattering edits that preserve your unique look and intent.

- One‑tap quality: go from casual snapshots to studio‑style portraits with minimal steps
- Professional, not plastic: edits are balanced and lifelike—skin stays natural, lighting feels realistic, and features retain character
- End‑to‑end workflow: upload → enhance → generate → download, all within a guided editor
- Cost and time savings: achieve results at under 1% of traditional photography costs
- Ready for sets: create themed and consistent portrait collections for weddings, travel, ID photos, street portraits, and more

## Portrait Retouch Editor

The editor is designed for clarity and control, so you can make confident adjustments and preview high‑quality results instantly.

- Upload multiple images (up to 15MB each), check selection counts, and add more at any time
- Beauty Enhancement presets across categories like Universal, Face Shape, Skin, Facial Features, Nose, Mouth & Teeth, Hair, and Artifacts Removal
- A free‑form prompt for creative edits—change attire, adjust posture, add accessories, and more
- Model selection with leading image models to match your style preferences
- Clear status updates while generating: pending, processing, success, or failed
- One‑click regenerate and download for fast iteration and sharing
