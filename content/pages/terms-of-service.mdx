# Terms of Service

## 1. Agreement

By accessing gridmaker.pro or using Grid Maker products (including the grid maker), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the services.

## 2. Service Description

Grid Maker provides tools to overlay grids on images, prepare print-ready references, and download outputs. Features may change or be enhanced over time.

## 3. Accounts & Security

- Provide accurate account information and keep credentials confidential.  
- You are responsible for all activity under your account.  
- Notify us promptly of unauthorized use or security issues.

## 4. Your Content

- You must have rights to the images and content you upload.  
- Do not upload unlawful, harmful, or infringing content, or images of individuals without appropriate consent.  
- You retain ownership of your uploads and outputs. You grant Grid Maker a limited license to process and store them to provide the service.  
- We may remove content that violates these Terms or the law.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You may not: (a) interfere with or disrupt the service; (b) attempt to reverse engineer, extract models, or bypass limits; (c) use the service for unlawful purposes, harassment, or deceptive/fraudulent content; (d) infringe intellectual property or privacy rights; (e) submit malicious code.

## 6. Intellectual Property

Grid Maker (name, brand, software, models, and documentation) remains our property or that of our licensors. Except for the limited rights you receive to use the services, no other rights are granted.

## 7. Payments & Credits

Pricing and any usage limits are shown in the product. Paid plans and credits are non-refundable except where required by law. Taxes may apply.

## 8. Availability & Changes

We aim for reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features with notice where feasible.

## 9. Disclaimers

Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” AI outputs may vary or be imperfect. We disclaim warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness, and non-infringement.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Grid Maker and its affiliates are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of profits, data, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability is limited to the amount you paid to Grid Maker for the services in the 3 months before the claim.

## 11. Indemnity

You will indemnify and hold harmless Grid Maker and its affiliates from claims arising from your content, your use of the services, or your violation of these Terms.

## 12. Governing Law & Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Grid Maker operates, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Disputes will be resolved in that venue, and you consent to its jurisdiction. Mandatory consumer protections in your country of residence still apply if required by law.

## 13. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or legal requirements. You may stop using the service at any time. Upon termination, your right to access the service ends, but Sections 6–12 survive.

## 14. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms. Material changes will be posted with an updated date. Continued use after changes means you accept the revised Terms.
