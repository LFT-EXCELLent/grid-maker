## Introduction

Grid Maker helps you overlay precise grids and prepare print-ready references. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. By using gridmaker.pro or related services, you agree to these practices.

## Information We Collect

- **Uploads & Generated Media**: Images you upload, settings you choose (e.g., grid overlays), and resulting outputs.  
- **Usage & Device Data**: Feature usage, logs, browser/device type, language, and diagnostics.  
- **Payments**: Billing name, email, and transaction details handled by payment providers (we do not store full card data).  
- **Cookies & Similar Tech**: To keep you signed in, remember preferences, and improve performance.

## How We Use Information

- Secure accounts, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues.  
- Communicate about updates, support, and service notices.

## Sharing

## Data Retention

- Uploads and generated assets: retained as needed to deliver the service; may be deleted sooner at your request or according to product settings.  
- Logs and analytics: retained for a limited period for security and service quality.

## Security

We use technical and organizational measures (encryption in transit, access controls, monitoring) to protect data. No method is 100% secure; please use strong passwords and protect your account.

## Your Choices

- Access, correct, or delete your personal data where applicable.  
- Request deletion of uploaded images and outputs.  
- Manage cookies via your browser settings.  
- Opt out of non-essential communications via provided controls.

Grid Maker is not directed to children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your region). Do not use the service if you are under the applicable age.

## International Transfers

Data may be processed in countries with different laws. We use appropriate safeguards where required to protect your information.

## Changes

We may update this policy. Significant changes will be posted here with an updated date. Continued use means you accept the revised policy.
