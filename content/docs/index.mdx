## Overview

Grid Maker is a browser-based tool that lets you upload an image, overlay a customizable grid, and export a reference file for drawing, sketching, or planning layouts. Everything runs online—no install—so you can stay focused on proportions and composition instead of measuring by hand.

## Core Capabilities

- **Upload & overlay**: JPG/PNG/WebP up to 15MB, drag-and-drop or file picker. Nothing leaves your browser.  
- **Grid controls**: Set rows/columns, adjust line color, opacity, and width, toggle labels (A1, B2…).  
- **Paper formats**: A2/A3/A4/A5, Letter, Legal, or custom sizes (mm).  
- **Preview & filters**: Live canvas preview with optional black-and-white conversion.  
- **Printing guide**: Auto-calculate line counts and intervals for the chosen paper size.  
- **Export**: Download your grid overlay as a high-resolution image for print or on-screen reference.

## Quick Start

1) Open Grid Maker and click **Upload Image** (or drag a file).  
2) Set **Rows** and **Columns**; choose **Line Color**, **Opacity**, **Width**, and **Show Labels**.  
3) Pick a **Paper Format** (or enter custom width/height in mm).  
4) Preview, optionally convert to **Black & White**, then **Download Grid Image**.  
5) Use the **Printing Guide** to draw matching lines on paper or confirm spacing for digital work.

## Detailed Settings

- **Grid Type**: Custom or Square; align to rows/columns ratio when using square mode.  
- **Labels**: Turn on/off cell labels (A1…); great for teaching and step-by-step transfers.  
- **Appearance**: Fine-tune line visibility with color, opacity, and stroke width to keep guides subtle.  
- **Paper Format**: Quickly switch among common sizes; custom mode supports exact dimensions in mm.

## Printing Guide (Auto)

For the selected paper size, Grid Maker shows:  
- Vertical lines count and interval; horizontal lines count and interval.  
- Label range (e.g., A1 to D4) when labels are enabled.  
Use these values to reproduce the grid on physical media or verify digital spacing.

## Tips for Best Results

- Choose a grid density that matches your drawing scale—fewer cells for loose sketches, more for detail.  
- Keep line opacity low for on-canvas drawing; raise opacity when printing.  
- Use square mode to maintain consistent proportions across devices or print sizes.  
- Re-download after changing paper size or line settings to keep guides accurate.

## FAQ (from landing)

- **Do I need software?** No—purely online; works on desktop, tablet, or phone.  
- **Can I use it for paper drawing?** Yes—print the overlay or mirror the intervals on your sketchbook/canvas.  
- **Photo layouts for social?** Yes—plan crops and compositions, then export references.  
- **Exports?** High-resolution images and printable references; keep on-screen or print.  
- **Cost/account?** Core features are free to start; no account required to try.
